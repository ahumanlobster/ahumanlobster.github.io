## **1. About this website** 








## **2. About me** 

* A lawyer by training, an artist by heart.
* My belief: you don't need a brush to be an artist. All you need is perspective. 
* Right now, I'm exploring my own art language. Wring is one of them, but there can be so many more. 
* I write to learn and clear my mind. Curiosity is my primary fuel. 
* [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com), [Masayoshi Son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masayoshi_Son), [Oki Sato](https://www.nendo.jp/en/) and [MC Escher](https://mcescher.com) have been my biggest intellectual influences so far. 

**If you read my blog and work in the field of art, tech, investment or geopolitics, or any intersections thereof, I would love to talk to you and would especially appreicate if you could drop me a line.**
