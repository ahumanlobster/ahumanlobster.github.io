## **1. About this website** 

The content here varies from art to philosophy to geopolitics to investment to book review. For now. 

I intend to write till the day I die. This website is used to upload my mind. I feel excited to experiment and witness how my way of thinking would evolve decades down the road. 


## **2. About me** 

* A lawyer by training, an artist by heart.
* I grew up in different cultures, and learned to survive as a minority at a very young age. 
* As such, I resonate strongly with Ai Weiwei's quote,  "*the world is a sphere, there is no East or West*" - regardless of its sarcastic connotation.
* I also believe that having a brush in hand doesn't necessarily make you an artist. Perspective distinguishes the best artist from the good. 
* Right now, I'm working on figuring out my own form of art expression. Writing is one of them, but there can be so many more. 
* I write to learn and clear my mind most of the time. Curiosity is my primary fuel. 
* [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com), [Masayoshi Son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masayoshi_Son), [Oki Sato](https://www.nendo.jp/en/) and [MC Escher](https://mcescher.com) have been my biggest intellectual influences so far. 

**If you happen to have expertise in art, tech, investment or geopolitics, or any intersections thereof, I would love to talk to you and would especially appreciate if you could drop me a line.** 

If you are not particularly intrigued by any of the above subjects, but still want to have a chat, feel free to reach out.
